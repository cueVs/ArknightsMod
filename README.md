# Hello, Doctor!
This Mod for Terraria is made for Arknights Doctor. I'm creating the Mod based on the idea of Arknights, adding my own interpretation.<br>
Have a good life of Arknights in Terraria, Doctor!

## What is Terraria?
Terraria is a land of adventure! A land of mystery! A land that's yours to shape, defend, and enjoy. Your options in Terraria are limitless. Are you an action gamer with an itchy trigger finger? A master builder? A collector? An explorer? There's something for everyone.<br>
Start by building basic shelter, then dig for ore and other resources. Discover and craft over 500 weapons of magic, ranged, melee and summon varieties, as well as armor, and use them to battle hundreds of different enemies. Soon you'll be going head-to-head with any of a dozen enormous bosses. Go fishing, ride a mount, find Floating Islands, build houses for helpful NPCs, and much, much more.

## What is Arknights?
Arknights is a mobile tower defense (TD) game developed by Hypergryph.  I think you Terraria lovers will love it!

## What can you do with the Mod?
You can play it as Arknights Doctor, and can use many items associated with many Operators.

## How to play?
